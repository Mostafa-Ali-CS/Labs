## Objective
- inroduction to offensive security.
- Hacking my first website (legally in a safe environment) and experience an ethical hackers job.
## Tools
- VM
- Terminal
- Gobuster (command-line app)
- Firefox Browser
## Steps
- Using Gobuster To Find Hidden Website Pages through terminal
- typing the hidden page into the FakeBank website using the browser's address bar
- authorized access to the Bank transfer page
- transfer was successful
## Lessons Learned
- Gobuster helped me to understand how easily hidden pages can be discovered if 
  proper access controls are not in place. 
- After getting authorized access to the bank transfer page which must be hidden and private, during my research
  i identified the vulnerability as Broken Access Control (from OWASP Top 10). 
- As an ethical hacker, i would (with permission) find vulnerabilities in the application and 
  report them to the bank to fix them before a threat actor exploits them.
